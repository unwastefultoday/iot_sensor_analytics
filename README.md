# IOT ANALYTICS EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING

The goal of the project is to:
**Explore sensor patterns**: Determine how readings from temperature, humidity, CO, LPG, smoke, light, and motion vary between devices.
**Identify environmental signatures:** Infer what each deviceâ€™s readings suggest about its placement (e.g., office, storage room, industrial area).
**Develop predictive analytics:** Construct a machine learning model that can classify the environment into one of three distinct labels based on sensor behavior.
**Explain model predictions:** Use SHAP values to understand the influence and interaction of different sensor features on the predictions.

**Data Overview**
The dataset consists of readings from three IoT devices. Each device logs data from seven sensors. Initially, the dataset includes: 
A Unix timestamp (ts)
A device identifier (device)
Sensor measurements for CO, humidity, light, LPG, motion, smoke, and temperature
